Management Software Project Stub

This is just a sample of a number of practices I implemented during my last employment. 
The project it's just a stub, it contains only a partial structure of the whole thing we use in our company. 
Beware: you may find many things in the code that are not correct nor best practices.

Canis is the idea behind an UWP Management Software.


Some of the stuff I used Canis as a test bench:


- MVVM pattern in UWP applications

- SQLITE syncing of remote data (MariaDB)

- Reflection-based Models (POCO) autogeneration (https://www.codeproject.com/articles/1009908/generic-listhelper-class-net)

- Code-generated UI instances (playing with binding, viewmodels' properties and both views and viewmodels inheritance)
